# The Mothbot
## praise be
---
This project is a little working hobby of mine that I call the Mothbot. It's just a small (well, not small anymore) project that I started when COVID really started to get bad, so I learned how to make something using the `discord.py` library, and here we are now.
### Key Features
1. Music player *with reaction controls*
2. Dice rolling
3. Chat nonsense
4. Generally having a laugh. 

Note: This bot was tailor made with a specific discord server in mind, so I can't guarantee that the jokes and other commands used here, you will find funny.
Another Note: Any tokens in previous commits are no longer valid. You can no longer use them to log into this bot user.
